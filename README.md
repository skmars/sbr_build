## Few-words

*Here we have a simple example of my sort of "hometask"*.
*Of course one could spent much more time to make this micro-microservice much more stable, extensible and covered by more tests.*
*But I was really excited to make it and at least few words from you guyes will be appriciated.*
*And no matter what, wish you all the best, stay safe and sound!* ðŸ’«
